"""End-to-end smoke matrix for split.py/get-base.py: every repo-preparation
variant (1.1-1.6 from the e2e test plan) combined with every branch-checkout
variant (2.1-2.9), run through the real "fake curl" get-base.py auto-mode
entry point, asserting the tool runs to completion without crashing and
without leaving an unresolved merge/cherry-pick/rebase behind.

This is deliberately shallow-but-wide -- it does not inspect commit content
in detail (see test_git_split_e2e_deep_flow.py for that). Branch-checkout
variants 5-8 all leave `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/batz` checked out; auto mode
always passes an explicit branch name to sync-splits (get-base.py's
auto_argv never uses the bare all-branches discovery form), so this matrix
does not exercise multi-branch discovery -- that's out of scope here.

Repo-variant 3 (README.md/.gitignore already committed on `mane` before
base/base is ever folded) combined with staying on `mane` (branch-checkout
1/2) is the smoke-level regression test for the history_master.py first-fold
auto-resolve fix: if that fix is missing or broken, this is where the matrix
first fails with a nonzero returncode (a real, unresolved MergeConflict).

Note: this suite fetches `base/base` from THIS repo's own real, currently
committed `base` branch (never GitHub) -- so it only ever exercises
whatever's actually been committed there, not any local uncommitted changes
to °split_lib itself. That's intentional (it tests the tool as a published
consuming repo would experience it), but it does mean local, not-yet-
committed fixes to °split_lib won't show up here until they land on `base`.
