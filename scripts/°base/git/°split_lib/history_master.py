"""(C) part 1: keep `ai/history/master` in sync with `master` and `base/base`.

No `git rebase --exec` (see ai/°base/errors/16.txt, 17.txt for the two real
failure classes that a `--exec`-driven rebase already hit in
`rebase_strip_claude_authorship.py`): a stale self-relocated script path, and
an unhandled conflict on a file that needed manual resolution. Both are
avoided here by driving the walk from a plain Python loop, using
`git_ops.cherry_pick`/`cherry_pick_continue`/`cherry_pick_abort` per ordinary
commit and an explicit merge-recreation procedure for base-merges.

See ai/°base/todo.md and the update-history-master design plan for the full
