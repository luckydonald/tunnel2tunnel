❯ The problem with the failed commit (which is not relevant) is `Co-Authored-By`. There should be a git commit hook - which would prevent this - and should be made sure to work by claude's init script - but never triggers?
Ah, I figured that the "deny" in the claude settings is executed first.
Is there a "on-deny" hook or similar we can hook into, to enhance it with that information that the `Co-Authored-By' and git actions which blindly add all files (`git add . …`, `git add -A …` etc.) are not allowed, instead of just the `Error: Permission to use Bash with command … has been denied.`.
So like our git hook would, if it were to run first/regardless (but it clearly shouldn't. Again, enrich the deny output)

❯ Yes, support both `git commit -m "*Co-Authored-By*"` and `git commit -F` where the file with the commit message is given, which we can then look into as well, to make sure. Support multiple variants of those flags, combined, too. If everything else fails, we still got the commit hook after all.

❯ _The only way to get rich messages is to remove the deny entries and let the `PermissionRequest` hook own the decision. The hook still denies — it just does so with explanation_ so the `PermissionRequest` hook only runs after the `deny` list?

❯ _PermissionRequest hook is effectively "runs before the *interactive* permission prompt, but after the *automatic* deny check."_ This is speculative, right? Can we check that in docs or somewhere?

❯ Create a hook for logging the plan mode decisions. Similar as we hook into `UserPromptSubmit`, I want to document the decisions taken when those multiple choice questions are asked - if possible with the full options to choose from - so it's clear later what the reasoning looked like.

❯ Commit, with prefix `[base] ai: Run: …`.

❯ wait, this commit contained `Co-Authored-By`. Why could we commit?

❯ Create proper test for it in the ai/tests folder.

❯ Also I've attempted your example from earlier, but parsing worked fine-ish, shlex did not error:
```py
>>> import shlex
>>> shlex.split("git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nfoo\nEOF\n)\"")
['git', 'commit', '-m', "$(cat <<'EOF'\nfoo\nEOF\n)"]
```

❯ Test for
```shell
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      [base] ai: Run: add PermissionRequest hooks for git add and Co-Authored-By policy

      Replace generic deny-list entries for `git add .` / `git add -A` with a
      `PermissionRequest` hooks that returns rich denial reasons. Also adds
      Co-Authored-By detection for `git commit` messages (via -m, --message=,
      or -F file). The commit-msg hooks remains as final fallback.
      EOF
      )"
```
as well.

❯ Now duplicate that test case with a proper co-Authored, and assert it fails because of shlex detecting it, not shlex erroring/the raw `x in y` workaround from earlier.

❯ commit this change

❯ Check d16d0a4f685c2871cda1b09a4ea56445d23f2d64, it could slip through.

⏺ Committed as d16d0a4. Note that .claude/settings.json wasn't picked up by git (likely gitignored), so only hook.sh was included in the commit — the settings change is still live
   on disk and active.

❯ Alright, commit that fix

❯ What does `Attribution is controlled via the settings.json` in the error message? I think that must be removed.

❯ Commit.

❯ /btw, is there a character suited for folder/file prefixes to imply "this is not very useful folder, don't look inside" like the dot would - and not taking up much space (dot is just a small symbol at the bottom of the "character field"), but which will in a typical folder/file sort appear _after_ all others - i.e. after `Z`?
❯ I've used `ai/°base` now, as that one is still easy enough to type on pretty much every system.

❯ Anyway, back to the `base` repo:
The @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-prompt/hook.sh (and @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-decision/hook.sh analogous) shall check if the current repo is `base` repo (this current singular prompt execution is) based on folder name and the fact that the remotes are `origin https://luckydonald@github.com/luckydonald/base.git` and `empty   https://luckydonald@github.com/EmptyAAS/empty.git`.
It shall not be a guard, but instead of writing to `ai/query.md` it shall write to `ai/°base/query.md`.
So check that:
1. the folder name is `base`
2. it has only `origin` and `empty` set as remotes
3. the url of origin is luckydonald/base (`.git`, `luckydonald@` optional)

❯ Set up the Git LFS to support `.png` and `.jp(e)g`. Make sure the `README.md` contains the necessary commands for setup.
❯ That readme change for git lfs install is not very thorough. It shall be part of the installation section properly, and definitly also in the quick copy-past command block.
❯ Also add the command for pre-commit, too.

❯ Edit @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-prompt/hook.sh to ignore if the message is just a single command of the following list: `/commit-with-lplp-style`.

❯ Earlier you managed to commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic>` again. Analyze why this managed to get past the `PermissionRequest` check.
The commit which I since rebased and fixed was `base 5338ebc` with the title `ai: skip logging for internal tooling prompt command`, so you can match it in the earlier log.
In any way, also add `<noreply@anthropic>` to the "forbidden" strings, like `Co-Authored-By`.
❯ For those kind of exceptions in there, make sure to raise those errors. Like instead, return a "deny" with the following deny text:
> COMMAND AUDIT ERROR: While trying to calculate if this command is allowed to execute, the script encountered an error. STOP EXECUTION NOW, and show the error to the user, so they can ask for that script to be fixed. Do not attempt to work around it unless specifically asked to by the user. Error message: ...
❯ As it's duplicated, have a func for that. Also, the stacktrace should be shown.

❯ Fix @.claude/hooks/permission-check.py - it allowed the last commit, clearly with `Co-Authored-By`.
Also figure out why the pre-commit hook (@ai/scripts/git/hook/commit/reject_co_authored_by.py) did not trigger or did not prevent it either (`git lfs` interfering?)
❯ First commit via commit style - the previous fixes you already did.

❯ If there is husky, make sure it plays nicely with the rest, and the result is what we want.
Is that yorkie still needed/installed? Should we uninstall it then?
Yeah, in the end I'd want `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`, that makes sense.
In fact there's also the push one, check out the claude `SessionStart` hook which tries to set it as there's no proper husky-like thingo available otherwise.
Ah, maybe we can merge those as `ai/scripts/init/checkout.sh`?
❯ yes, continue with the checkout.sh consolidation
❯ `ai: recorded decision` should be squashed/amended the same way `ai: updated prompt` does

❯ Write me a hook where changing/creating a plan copies it to ài/plans/*.md` and commits it via claude hook py script

Enable it with `--enable hooks` or `[features].hooks` in config.toml. See https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic#feature-flags for details.
› Instead, have a python part in the sync script check for that - and fix it after a y/n/exit. Exit shows the path exactly for convenience.

› Fix the `°base` folder selection for automatic `ai: updated prompt` commits broken with either b142385153f6b44d208532036b95a1cb4dd9c9b2 - or they were never working for `codex` before (only `claude`). While at it, make sure those automated commits - including plans and such will prefix commit with `[base] ` like usual for this repository.

See commit dbe390bf1766c8227fc3d9c37315a00e7629d8a9 first writing the plan to the query file,
and then immediatly after writing garbage (stdout apparently) to a new plan file in 8f9f93cf2fa3eec36bc3cc69c5f16faac49e584c.
Instead it should write what was in the query file to the plan file.
Make sure to not corrupt the code for claude, the fix only applies to codex.
Also check if this message starting of the plan gets autocommited at least.

› Note that the files mentioned in the commits where fixed manually later by me.

› Migrate claude hook setup to also have a claude param to the script - the commit one already does it like that.

› The $commit-with-lplp-style skill is not good in selecting the word after the `[where]`. Currently it often writes stuff like `[fronend] fix: ai: Run: …`, but it shouldn't be this feat/fix/… commit style (forgot the name), but the component or topic of the change. I.e. `[frontend] admin: Implemented user deletion UI.` or `[backend] models: Added models for cool feature.`. If we're rather on a feature branch or doing a lot of work on the same feature `[backend] cool feature: Added the models.` or similar is possible too. Also notice that every commit shall be ended with a sentence separator, e.g. `.:,!?`. It doesn't need to be a full sentence for that, and the choice is rather based on the rest of the message; Like if you need the information in the detailed rest of the commit message, then it would indicate that with an `:`, otherwise, if it can stand on it's own, and the body is only enhancing it, it would be `.` Usually `.` is the right choice.

Like it's fine to add code and plan, the issue is if the plan is overwritten by a later plan - i.e. loosing the history of plan changes.
Same goes with merging the prompt file commits etc. If it meaningfully changes the query - or is a totally separate topic altoghether, it should stay separate.

❯ Add the git username config to the README. In the copy block, add as last line that the name should be `Lucky Lucy` - the email can be different and does not need to be checked. Below add a second code block setting the git local vars for email + name, using this repo as values for now.

❯ No, in the first block don't SET it, ASSERT it, calling it out if wrong in red text

❯ I reverted that commit. I meant @scripts/°base/git/remote/fix_username.py

❯ It's a TUI app. Ask to fix it.

❯ Add a flag to yes them ahead of time. If they are correct it's a noop.

(blockquote me, not in prompt). Then it repeats the full file we just captured earlier with the `save plan …` commit. That shall be stripped.

❯ /init but write it at `ai/°base/AGENTS.md`, and in the root `CLAUDE.md` instruct the AI to only read that file if you are base repo (dir name, git origin, whatever is fastest for you to figure out - i.e. is based on already available metadata - i.e. the system prompt, etc.). Tell immediatly that other projects using this _base_ are expected to overwrite the root `CLAUDE.md`. But as it's an automatic prompt, it shall be lightwight!

❯ /plan the claude hooks for plan mode are no longer triggering commits & adding the files to the correct folder it seems.

❯ I am now telling you to change something in that plan. Doing so should result in two changes:
1. Immediatly this very prompt is added at the end of `ai/°base/query.md`, and
2. after you wrote the new plan, `ai/°base/plans/010_*.md` should be updated by the file access or some relevant hook.
You can inspect **1.** right away, so you can see if that already needs fixing.
For **2.** we will see that after you update the plan. You will ask me to start implementing, and I will have to reject again, so you are given a chance to inspect the result before going into actual implementation phase.

❯ Thanks. I got the following options to choose from, where I exited out with number **4**:
> Claude has written up a plan and is ready to execute. Would you like to proceed?
>
>   1. Yes, and use auto mode
>   2. Yes, manually approve edits
>   3. No, refine with plan on Claude Code on the web
> ❯ 4. Tell Claude what to change
>      shift+tab to approve with this feedback
>
> ctrl+g to edit in  Vim  · ~/.claude/plans/toasty-crafting-origami.md
You should now check that the updated plan has a commit as well.
Afterwards we need to check option **1**, that it commits to the query as well, something about starting the implementation, and once more linking the plan. Obviously that can't be done in planning mode.

❯ Exiting again to give you another check round. Also please activte the lplp-commit-style skill when implementing the fix.
❯ /plan test plan for what we just implemented. Please tell me how to best test.

❯ I feel like this should have been plan #11, as it's too different?

❯ Check if the following is correct: @ai/°base/errors/8.md
Note, it's from claude at `/Users/user/Documents/programming/Shell/archive_apps`.

❯ But query and answer shouldn't be `0 chars`?

❯ Again, don't attepmt to fix `archive_apps`, the fix will land there eventually. Fix it here.

❯ /plan Back to that other claude session at `/Users/user/Documents/programming/Shell/archive_apps/`, in commit `ff301248d9cc1dbebd8d4d0a09dbf90b7b20a991` we asked claude to `❯ document your learnings.`, and it did so.
I can see the following writes, but it never seem to have triggered commits mirroring those to the local git, as the hooks should. Please investigate. The commands it triggered:
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/feedback_testing_archive_apps.md)`
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/project_ditto_zip_cp437.md)`
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/project_checksums_locale_sort.md)`
- `Write(/Users/user/.claude/projects/-Users-user-Documents-programming-Shell-archive-apps/memory/MEMORY.md)`
You should fix the issue only in this base repo, the fixes will be merged there eventually.

❯ /plan I want to have explore commands written to the prompt log, similar to `Task Notification:`.
Claude CLI writes:
```log
Explore(Explore record-memory hook and commit logic)
  ⎿  Done (33 tool uses · 46.9k tokens · 1m 41s)
```
I think we could write it like this:

@ai/°base/errors/9.expected.md

Activate /commit-with-lplp-style when executing the plan.

❯ Change the output dir for agent stuff to `ai/output/agents/NNN.task-id/` (+`output`)

❯ do not squash for this single time, I'll do it myself.

❯ /plan If `ai/.debug` file exists, all AI hooks shall write their payload to `ai/output/debug/`. Adapt paths for `°base` as usual.

❯ Here's some more stuff to do, they should all be commited separately, following the lplp style skill.
1. `.debug` as above.
2. Record `/compact` results, too.
3. For the `Task Notification:` prompt update, from [5.expected.md](./errors/5.expected.md), the last line (tools, tokens, time) is missing. Implement it.
4. Fix prompts-while-running for claude being lost.
   E.g. in this repo/prompt (blockquote me):
   > Change the output dir for agent stuff to `ai/output/agents/NNN.task-id/` (+`output`)

❯ For implementing `/compact`, see @ai/°base/errors/10.md and @ai/°base/errors/10.expected.md
❯ /plan For ai hook testing purposes, send me a few questions in all the different formats you can do (single choice, multi choice, with/without code examples, etc.)

❯ Alright, let's modernize the question prompt log.
Currently, we have question output to `query.md` like @ai/°base/errors/12.md
Instead I want it changed to @ai/°base/errors/12.expected.md

Construct a unittest using `12.expected.md`'s `json` under **Input JSON (Claude)** as input and asserting the markdown under **`query.md` addition** as output.
For implementing, the sections **Summary of format options** and **Notes** may be helpful.

❯ /plan uuuuh... now adopt the implementation, lol

❯ But it is still compatible with the codex one, yes?

❯ alright, extract the codex questions from `/Users/user/Documents/programming/LUA/GrandMA2/GMA2ColorPicker/ai/query.md` to `./ai/°base/errors/13.md` and reconstruct the original payloads of the call to `13.expected.md`, similar to the `12.md` variants.

❯ using the files in @ai/°base/output/debug/ you can see that you get an understanding for the codex prompt result, so we can incorporate that to the hook script which writes it to `query.md`.
❯ Improve that by migrating both AI's input to one universal pydantic model we define and type properly - and where the rendering then can easily work with attributes, instead of guessing json dict keys.

❯ /plan Improve that by migrating both AI's input to one universal pydantic model we define and type properly - and where the rendering then can easily work with attributes, instead of guessing json dict keys.

❯ There is no need to separate `Option`, `Annotation` and `DecisionPlayload`? Like, we're only looking at filled-out questions with 0-4 answers (codex can timeout getting zero results, claude can multi-select but is limited to max 4).
So I guess a flatter `Question` + `Choice` should be sufficent? The `Question` would have the "global" attributes like if it's multi, or if it timeouted (can be computed prop), and of cause a list of choices. And `Choice` will contain name, id, selection state, text note, etc.

❯ what is the mcp tool definition for request_user_input? Please repeat verbatim.

❯ 1. What's the difference between `notes`, `custom_text`and `selected_preview`?
2. `selected_preview` is redundant with `rank` being a defacto `selected` boolean.
3. Actually, add a `Choice.selected -> bool` computed prop. And while at it, a `Question.selected -> Choice[]` computed, too.

❯ Regarding

> 1. `notes` = the annotation note field — used when the user adds a note without selecting a label (single-select "(notes only)"), or as the Codex `user_note`: alongside any selection. Rendered as `[x] _Notes:_ > {text}` in single-select, or as the note accompanying a Codex answer.

This sounds like it's better to move that into the `Choice`, attached to the selected answer. The `other` question may be automatically added by the parsers, so the display part can be dumb.

❯ Actually, like we have claude tests, construct some automated parsing tests for codex as well.
Note, the definitions for codex are at @ai/references/https/github.com/openai/codex/blob/49614a0391d83eec442ffeca1d4aa0fdeb119818/codex-rs/protocol/src/request_user_input.rs

❯ Fix @ai/°base/errors/15.md

❯ Write another test utilizing `ai/°base/output/debug/20260624-152802_886401-save-decision.json` and `ai/°base/output/debug/20260624-153111_724937-save-decision.json` as input and an expected output (`15.expected.md`)

❯ I prettly slightly changed the format of `15.expected.md` - Changing the sections to be split by `---\n# {num}\n` and the metadata/imput now being `## Input\n| test | {num} |\n| - | - |\n| type | {codex/claude} |\n| file | \`{file in the °base outputs}\` |`. Dynamically use that table as the subtest (add one initial assertion of that subtest that both `{num}` are the same, and a separete outer test that they are a sequence starting at `0` or `1`). The parsing should be dynamic, the intention is to add more examples over time. So subtest title should be the `{num}`, the type and the file.

❯ Add a `--preview=<file>` flag to render the markdown to `stdout` instead - to quickly validate a question payload json. Allow the following formats:
- a) filename only (e.g. `20260624-152802_886401-save-decision.json`): Look into `ai/°base/output/debug/` and `ai/output/debug/`.
- b) relative path to repo root (e.g `ai/output/debug/….json` or `/ai/output/debug/….json` or `../other-project/ai/output/debug/….json`)
- c) absolute path (must start with `/`)
- d) relative path to script (e.g. `something.json` - would be in `ai/jooks/save-prompt/`)
- e) relative path to current codex/claude dir (usually repo root, but subprojects within a bigger project are possible - e.g. `../ai/output/debug/….json`)

❯ for the lplp commit skill, make it clear that you should always make sure to not accidentially commit irrevelent files, and limit just to the ones changed yourself.

› Fix ai/°base/errors/16.txt and ai/°base/errors/17.txt

› write a python script at `scripts/°base/ai/references/download-link.py`, which
- input: URL
- processes arg 1 or asks for input, fails if no tty and nothing piped in with error how to do it instead.
- Take url as folder path (remove schema's `:` though)
- write output to `ai/references/{path}`.
- fetches url and writes to file
- use `uv` to install some html-to-markdown parser
- `uv` shebang
- basically for downloading documentation
- cases:
  1. link ends in `.md`
     - can be downloaded directy
     - path as is
  2. link does not end in `.md`
     - attempt if `.md` version exists
     - try with and without original extension
     - Examples:
       - `/docs/foo` -> `/docs/foo.md`
       - `/docs/bar.html` -> `/docs/bar.md`, `/docs/bar.html.md`
  3. Link is on github
     - grab permalink
       1. basically api lookup for the repo's current commit
          - `curl -sS -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/git/ref/heads/BRANCH | jq -r .object.sha`
       2. Construct back the full URL with the blob/COMMIT
     - actually download from the `raw.githubusercontent.com` page instead
  4. other git hoster
     - similar to github
     - gitlab, bitbucket, sourceforge, AWS CodeCommit, SourceHut, Codeberg, Launchpad
     - gitlab selfhosted, gitea, Forgejo, Radicle, other selfhosted
  5. readthedocs
     - if not latest use the version in the url (i.e. 2.3.4) as is - normal url parsing should work
     - the filename should not be `_.md` but the revision (in footer of document)
  5. HTML pages
     - convert to markdown
     - attach `/_.md` for writing the file.
- tests:
  - `https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced#profiles` -> `ai/resources/https/developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced.md`

› You may extract the `download-link.py` to have `°dllink_lib/*.py` (or subfolders in that), to organize the code better. Including `°dllink_lib.providers.*` packages, etc. `download-link.py` is still the command starting point.

› In the script, add the flags `--no-git-add` and `--no-open-ide`, and the default behaviour to `git add` the downloaded file, and open the file in the IDE.

❯ for loading the skills for codex and claude, would it make sense to just symlink them instead of writing the wrappers into .codex and .claude?

❯ All Linux/Mac, no Windows checkouts.

❯ /plan check out `scripts/°base/ai/settings/sync.py`. It should be able to parse old versions of the config files (version 1, fix the missing bump to two btw)
An example would be the before-after of file `ai/tool-settings/settings.json` in commit `95f48bc69b93f990ce7986344ca05722192c4ff1`
Additionally I'd like the following changes, while at it:
2. `enabled` booleans shall always come as first in json or toml export.
3. `permissions`.`allow`/`deny`'s elements should be singleline each.
4. if there's `enabled…`/`disabled…` variants (MCP, Plugins, etc.), always populate both arrays, and make sure they have a linesplit for best possible diffs.
5. A MCP server with a tool will be synced to claude/codex, but then replace back the original MCP in the ai/…/settings.json - hence replacing the short `"tool"` version with an merged longer `"cmd"` containing the tool invocation hardcoded.
  - a) detect the case of inlining a tool directly
  - b) detect matching existing tools to extract them from `"cmd"`.
  - c) improve merge strategy to not be weird.
6. `mcp.tools.<tool>.<variant>.cmd` and `mcp.servers.<name>.cmd` shall be single line.
7. `enabledPlugins` should be just be `plugins` in the settings file, and have `enabled` flag as well (respecting **2.** and **4.**).

❯ For the old version parsing, most of it the claude parser should be able to parse it, as it has been the plain claude schema at first anyways. The current missmatch with the already converted ones should be carefully considered if the file says v1, but can be skipped for a proper v2 once we're done here.

❯ Alright, let's assume sync.opy or the readme/agends.md might be wrong in how to handle skills.
I want to have a way to easily call the skill with autocompletion. Codex allows `$skill` so this `/skill` wrapper looked like the second best way fot claude?

❯ /plan check on settings sync design plan agent

❯ then run it now, to see it's handling the unmarked v1.5 properly.

❯ Why are my plugins and skills listed multiple times?

❯ Alright, let's clean it up.

❯ /skill-creator:skill-creator

❯ Adding bugsink sentry configuration to a project. For now add python and vue, especially the commits after `195f7383dd37bad36d4cb3d10a93b5fc0bdee539` should be helpful. Be generic, not bound to this repo, so we can use it in base.

❯ Actually write it as multiple files, and adapt the sync script. If that means we can split it by language, that means we can collect those (currently: vue, python) over time, but also not spam context with irrelevent stuff we don't need for a specific project using specific languages.

❯ /skill-creator:skill-creator

❯ Check out the skill at `ai/skills/bugsink-setup/`, and update it to also include rust via @ai/references/https/docs.sentry.io/platforms/rust.md and @ai/references/https/docs.sentry.io/platforms/rust/

❯ In case of merges, I want the sync check hook not block for the `.local` file variants. Furthermore, in case of merges, automatically sync, but keep a `settings.(local.)bak.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json` around (similar with the other files)

❯ Update the LPLP style to allow code ticks in the first line of the commit message, and to not add length-based linebreaks to the body text of the commit message - instead keep the paragraphs or bullet points unsplit.

❯ Add a hint to the sentry skill that usually frontend/backend are separate DSNs, and hence need separate env vars.

❯ the settings-to-claude part does not properly escape `{"type": "bash", "command": "…(…)…"}` to `"Bash(…\\(…\\)…)".

❯ Fix the broken test or the reason it breaks.

❯ Fix the reorder of `dae9933490c25c407dcd5fa0d5535140c7e3de08`.

❯ Improve the `scripts/°base/init/link-subproject-claude.sh` to actually link the `.codex` folder and the `ai/tool-settings` folders, too.
It should also get the same `AGENTS.md` -> `CLAUDE.md` symlink - moving `an possible `AGENTS.md` to `CLAUDE.md` for consistency.
If files pre-exist, keep them as `{name}.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.bak.{ext}`.
The symlinks and such shall be `git add`ed.
Any root files I forgot which are needed for `claude`/`codex` to function in the subfolder shall be symlinked as well.

❯ /plan I need to create a tool for splitting off AI stuff & `base` from a project, as that project is not supposed to have this base or AI mentions in it.
The general concept is that for a branch, AI versions can exist.
Generally, there's the clean branch with any name, but examples could be `feature/ABC-123/something/mr1`, `feature/ABC-123_something`, `ABC-1234_foo`, `bugfix/foo-crash` or just `i-did-a-thing`.
This now gets two additional branches, one for direct work and commits (unclean) and one for tracking commit relations etc. (history)

type | branch name format | purpose
--- | --- | ---
clean | `{branch}` | the clean branch, not containing any mention of or commits from this base or anything related to AI assistant usage (prompts, refs, etc.). This one is save to release to the public or the customer.
unclean | `ai/UNCLEAN/{branch}` | this is the branch to work on. It will allow you to commit ai, non-ai (code), or a mix of both as you want, making actually editing code etc. easier.
history | `ai/history/{branch}` | this stores the metadata, and ai stuff, basically it's the left overs after you extract the clean parts from the unclean branch. So it contains every change which is not part of the code, so we can still reuse our AI instructions for later branches as well, e.g. `CLAUDE.md`. Also contains all metadata to sync the stripped down **clean** with the other branches.

The general concept is to have those be synced automatically.
There's also a `ai/history/master` branch (or whatever the repo's main branch is, `master`, `main`, `mane`, etc.),
which will be holding the history of the AI stuff for after a **clean** variant was merged into the main branch. It then is the base for the next **unclean** and hence also the next **history** branch - while the main branch itself is the base for the new **clean** branch.

#### `update-history-master`
The script needs a `update-history-master` command, which does create a new base history.
The master history is constructed like this in terms of commits:

category | sorting | description
--- | --- | ---
`master` | comes first | all commits from the origin's current main branch)
base | after `master` | this are merge commits of `base/base` into the `ai/history/master`.
**history** | after `master` | commits of all **history** branches which **clean** branches were already merged into master.
merge | after `master` | this are empty commits marking/referencing the last (= merge) commit merge of an **clean** branch which had **history** into master, so it comes after the rebased commits of that **history** branch.

The difficult part is that after an update of **clean `master`**, the **`master` history** shall be rebased onto that.
While that `master` is updated, we need to keep track of merges of **clean** branches which have an existing **history** or **unclean** variant, so we can cherry-pick those commits, too.

With that general rebase strategy, and flattening the history of already-merged ai branches, it's gonna be difficult to support merging this `base`, and later on updates to the `base` to it occasionally.
How can we handle that gracefully?

Additionally, there should be a `--force-merge=<branch name>` option (multiple), which would force a manual history branch merge before it is actually included in the clean master.

It does roughly the following:
1. checkout `master`
2. check if `master` is up to date, if not, ask whether we should `git pull` (default: N)
3. checkout `base`
4. check if `base` is up to date, if not, ask whether we should `git pull` (default: N)
5. check out `ai/history/master`
6. rebase `ai/history/master` onto `master`
7. merge the most recent `base/base` into `ai/history/master`.

The problem to think about is how we handle `base/base` merges. Merges doesn't really like rebases...
Maybe the script manually rebases, processing the changes as usual until those would occur, then automatically merge the old merged commit of `base/base` freshly into `ai/history/master` (again), while applying the old conflict resolution once more (so if we can't rebase a merge, we instead recreate it).

#### `sync-splits`
This subcommand allows to sync **clean**, **unclean** and **history** versions of a branch.
Those branches not created yet will be added.

##### Generating **clean**
Take **unclean** and strip all AI content, and outright drop ai-only commits.

A branch's **clean** branch will start on the `master` branch, and add commits to that.

##### Generating **history**
Take **unclean** and strip all code content, but keep the commits even if empty.
Add metadata to commits or add specifically crafted metadata commits to store everything needed to sync an **clean** branch with an **history** branch back to **unclean**.

A branch's **history** branch will start on the `ai/history/master`, and add commits to that.

##### Generating **unclean**
This is the most difficult one, as you need to merge **clean** and **history** back.

Steps:
1. Start from `history/master` (i.e. the specific commit of `history/master` the branches **history** is based on, so that all the previous AI stuff is contained.
2. Cherry-pick the commits from **clean** and **history** in order.

In that there can be different commits to process:
1. code only
    - the commit exists only in **clean**, and there's no relating **history** for it
      - e.g. it is a quick commit added after the last sync, i.e. to hotfix something, or if ai was not needed.
2. history only
    - this commit exist only in **history** and there's no **clean** commit matching.
      - e.g. just an update to `CLAUDE.md` without any code changes.
3. code + history
   - the commit is in both other branches, and can be merged back into a single commit.
     - e.g. prompt/query file update + the actually implemented changes.

A branch's **unclean** branch will start on the `ai/history/master`, and add commits to that.

#### `rebase-branches-to-master`
This one takes all of the three branches and rebases it onto the current `master` variants.

- **clean**
    - This one will be rebased onto the also **clean** `master` branch.
- **history**
    - This will be rebased onto the`ai/history/master` branch.
- **unclean**
    - This will be rebased onto the **history** branch just created.

Also think about how to handle one or two of them branches missing.


---

Additionally, we need:

1. branch push name check
   1. do not allow **unclean** or **history** format-named branches to be pushed to a remote called `origin`.
2. branch push content check
   1. block ai or ai-containing commits to be pushed if the branch name is not **unclean** format.
   2. block code or code-containing commits to be pushed if the branch name is not **history** format.

❯ That's good, keep that. However, what I meant is, that if I'm in a clean branch, by definition will not have the scripts available, as they are to be classified AI content (base, to be specific).
What are my options here?

❯ There's also the case that I might have never even checked out or added `base/base` to an repository, which I feel is related but not exactly the same.

❯ No, for the "no base in project", it would need to go into a possibly new `ai/history/master` anyways - we can't touch the `master`.

❯ What I was thinking was more like one of these `curl raw.github…` kinda snippets which would execute a self-contained python script doing at least the setup - that is, adding & fetching the remote, under an settable `BASE_GIT_USERNAME=luckydonald` (for an `luckydonald@github.com` remote address).
This script can be just in this base repo, but quickly accessable via network piping magic.
it would set up the `base` remote, and then execute the rest via local worktree.
Note it should be possible to spam it in any branch or repo with or without base, and work correctly.

❯ The remote is expected to always be named `base`, to not mix it up with `origin` or any other remote which may have an unrelated branch named `base`.

❯ Explain `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckydonald/base/master/scripts/°base/git/get-base.py | python3 - bootstrap-branch feature`

❯ Add this very explainer to the plan file, that helped.

❯ Similar put in a explainer of `update-history-master --yes` there as well, then we're ready to exit plan mode.

❯ Move that after the curl one, though

❯ /plan The curl command needs to be documented in the `base`'s `README.md`.
I want a parameterless version where it does the right thing automatically, as I will not remember `bootstrap-branch feature` or `update-history-master --yes`.
Also it's better to write the full branch, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckydonald/base/refs/heads/base/<path>`, not just trusting `/master` to exist.

Yes, do fix that.

❯ /plan Additionally I'm not sure if when updating master to the newest version, the `base/base` is pulled in. I believe `update-history-master --yes` should do that after previous steps. So it would be like this:
0. check out **clean** `master`.
1. "rebase" of existing commits.
2. "merge" of other **history** branched now available to **clean** master.
3. pull in and merge newest `base/base`.

Additionally it should collect the commands to rest that, e.g.

> ```shell

> git update-ref refs/heads/'ai/history/master' 'c8d15c81cb2afaec9ba0fe1de5a7009e4f67b857'

Currently it's kinda spamming you with lotsa stuff, and is super confusing. I guess it needs to be more verbose and tell the user what it's doing - in the log file, too.
And structure it better somehow, maybe by action.

❯ Before part A you should improve the logging substantially, so we have the best possible insights - while still taking readability into account.

❯ Now you dropped learning from B again.

1. add logging.
2. fix that git manually and/or using/running the script.
3. see what we can improve in the scripts from the learnings of **2.**.

For the `ai/query.md`, if the "headline" instructions from `base` are not there, they go first, then everything from the actual repo's `ai/query.md`. Usually this is only causing merge conflicts later, if lines were added accidentially from the base repo, and hence later on removed again. That net 0 change still is causing a diff "oh now it changed", even if it is the same as before in base, and hence using the repo one would be enough. `ai/scripts` this file is kinda intentional, why is it causing a conflict? Is there a folder there? In that case moving the files to `scripts/` (without `°base`, as that's a project repo).

❯ [[PLAN]] I want to create an implementation plan. Please:
1. Analyze the codebase to understand the current state
2. Ask clarifying questions if my request is ambiguous
3. Create a structured plan and save it to the plan file in the session folder

My request: Check out @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/ and make sure those are compatible with Copilot, too

❯ [[PLAN]] You (copilot) said `plan finalized in  plan.md , todos in SQL.`. Can we add those todos to the local plan file, too?

❯ [[PLAN]] I don't want you to mirror it in this very plan, I want the hook to extract them and add them automatically in the future.

❯ You have not yet marked the task as complete using the task_complete tool. If you were planning, stop planning and start implementing. You aren't done until you have fully completed the task.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT call task_complete if:
- You have open questions or ambiguities - make good decisions and keep working
- You encountered an error - try to resolve it or find an alternative approach
- There are remaining steps - complete them first

Keep working autonomously until the task is truly finished, then call task_complete.

❯ Use the skill tool to invoke the "commit-with-lplp-style" skill, then follow the skill's instructions.

❯ commit without amending for now, I will fix this commit manually

◆ [[PLAN]] Have a look at commit `6b46749e304dc8acb6aabca7b9e93378282c0b09` to `4196168d48400370bff9149f3761c8605171f4cf`.
Those mostly are wrong additions to `query.md` - tool responses which instead should go to the `output/agents` or similar. You can see your own history and compare those.
Also you can check the last files in `ai/°base/output/debug/*.json` for the specific input. If you find a few representative ones, you many `git add` them, and use them in unit tests.
While at it, also check the TODO updates earlier (when you marked todos as done), which should cause a commit, too.

◆ The commit `092e22a520dcae1ce329467182922895eff78f12` is surely rather an (Subagent) accidentially commiting it's query.

◆ Alright, squash the branch since `6b46749e304dc8acb6aabca7b9e93378282c0b09` into multiple commits, i.e. keeping a commit for each plan state.

◆ /plan ask me all the types of questions you have available.

◆ Alright, none of those question caused a question added to the `query.md` log.

◆ The verifications - are they automated tests? In that case the jsons need to be added to git.

    "trailer": "X-foo: asdf\nX-bar: fghj",
}
```
so you can later track/check references for the "history" branch and so on.

1. prepare temporary repo (master/main branch is to be named `mane` there) with the following variations:
   1. a few random commits
   2. starting with the initial commit from `empty/init` (add origin as in `README.md`), then random commits
   3. commit a few commits, and then also write a `README.md` and `.gitignore` (can be short, just to test conflict behavior)
   4. starting with a branch based on the most recent commit of this `base/base` (checkout by cloning from this direrctory, not online), and then a few random commits
   5. random commits + `empty/init` merge + `base/base` merge + random commits (see `README.md`and again, `base` is via dir, not github)
   6. Similar to **1.5.** above, but then merge `base/base` a second time into `mane` (`--no-ff`), and commit a few more commits, including some into `ai` (see **2.8.** below)
2. check out branches with the following variations:
   1. stay on `mane`
   2. `mane` + couple commits
   3. new branch `feature/foobar` + couple random commits
   4. new branch `test_idk_lol` + couple random commits
   5. new branch `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/batz` + couple code commits
   6. new branch `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/batz` + couple ai-folder commits
   7. new branch `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/batz` + couple both-in-same-commit commits.
   8. new branch `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/batz` + couple ai-folder, couple code + couple both-in-same-commit commits + ai + code + both.
   9. new branch `ai/history/mane` + 2 "ai"-only commits + **2.8.**
3. Now apply the script via "fake curl" from this repo (again, online version on github might not be in sync)
4. It shall be merging cleanly (`README.md` and `.gitignore` shall be handled by the script automatically after all)
5. create `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/test-eins` branch, and commits as described in **2.8.**.
6. use the script to generate `feature/test-eins` from it.
7. Check that `feature/test-eins` exits and contains:
   1. no `base/base` merge:
      1. no `base/base` at all (**1.1.** through **1.3.**)
      2. only the original `base/base`, not a second merge (**1.4.**, **1.5.**)
      3. only the original two merges with `base/base`, not a third merge (**1.6.**)
   2. No commits touching `ai/**` or similar.
   3. Only the code & "both" commits from `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/test-eins`
   4. For the "both" commits they shall only contain the "code" half, nothing from "ai".
8. Check that `ai/history/feature/test-eins` exists and contains:
   1. All commits from `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/test-eins` in the same order and with the same commit metadata (except the trailers)
      - check the commit hashes in the trailers to be correct.
      - no newly introduced commits in-between
   2. The commits do not contain "code"
      1. "ai" -> "ai" (unchanged)
      2. "both" -> "ai" (no code)
      3. "code" -> "none" (empty commit)
9. Commit 2 commits to `mane`
10. Have the script rebase the branches
11. check `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/test-eins` and `ai/history/feature/test-eins`
    - They should be based on the newest `mane` now.
    - Except **2.9.**,
      - there the `ai/history/mane` should be base on the new `mane`,
      - and `ai/UNCLEAN/feature/test-eins` and `ai/history/feature/test-eins` shall be based on that `ai/history/mane`.

* Correct.
###### 3
> Step 7's "no new base/base merge on feature/test-eins" check therefore can't be a trailer lookup (there'd be zero matches even correctly) — it must count actual 2-parent merge commits reachable from feature/test-eins whose second parent traces into the pinned base branch history, and assert that count against what mane already had before feature/test-eins forked.

> The problem: repo variants 5/6 merge base/base into mane before feature/test-eins even exists. Those merges are ordinary git merge --no-ff calls we run ourselves during fixture setup — they never get the X-Base-History-Merge-Kind trailer (only _fold_base/recreate_base_merge add that, and those only ever touch ai/history/{main}, never mane). So by the time sync-splits creates feature/test-eins off mane, those merge commits are just ordinary ancestry with no marker distinguishing them as "base merges" — a trailer lookup would find nothing, correctly, but that tells us nothing useful either.

Yes, but the script must still work even if there's already `base/base` in the history before we started the splittidui - in that case rather warn that we can't remove the previous ones, but at least keep everything of this branch clean..

This is a real crash-risk bug in the replay loop itself, not a design question -- fix: detect "this replay step is a merge git can't cherry-pick" and skip it with a warning (leaving it as inherited ancestry) instead of crashing, while everything the tool adds afterward stays correctly split._

› In this base, how can I best provide code style guidelines without spamming every subproject with unneeded tokens - especially if they don't use that language?

› Here's my python rules:
Do not use `_` prefixes. We don't do "private" classes/functions here. Instead separate stuff out in modules where it makes sense.
End logical indetion with an `# end <word>`, i.e. `# end if`: `if`, `with`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`. No repeating of the class/func name. Just a simple comment based closing bracket basically, to enhance readability.

› `async def foo():` => `# end def`

› Alright, do that and commit LPLP style

› apply `curl -fSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luckydonald/base/refs/heads/base/scripts/%C2%B0base/git/get-base.py | python3 -` (but via local `cat get-base.py | python3`) to `/path/to/<redacted>/frontend` - to see if we have any outstanding bugs.

› Alright, fix the stale `base-tools` by deleting & recreating it. Call it `luckydonald/base#get-base.py`, so it's unique enough that we wouldn't hit (and delete) user workspaces accidentally.

› Also show propper git stderr instead of showing only an unhelpful CalledProcessError traceback.

› When moving those bases around, _backup_ the previous ones by tagging the commits with `bak/split/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/{clean,UNCLEAN,history}`. That date is the same for the same run.

› We need a way to configure the `✨❯ Lucky Lucy` name, and the email.

❯ I think you analyized the wrong `query.md`. I meant the section under `#### General AI development guidelines` in `ai/query.md`; not the whole log of `ai/°base/query.md`.

❯ Extract testing, too.

❯ Add to the `py.md` that there shouldn't be "private" function, classes or files starting with `_`.
Rather look into extracting functions as a module to import from.

❯ Planning should ask once per session if lplp commit style should be enabled for the implementation (choices: yes, no)

› Add `ai/skills/code-style/references/yarn.md` and reference it from `ts.md`.
It should describe in detail how to set up `yarn@4` aka. `yarn berry`.
You can inspect `../../littlepipslittleparty/pipbuck` for that `yarn` usage — docker (compose), github actions, project usage, `package.json`, lock files, `.yarn`, `.yarnrc`, `.gitignore`, `.pnp.*`, `corepack`, commit history, etc.
Add a pre-commit hook, which if enabled in `settings.json`, prevents old yarn version files (especially the common v2) to be commited accidentially (I can think of at least the lock files, and a `node_modules/` dir — though a gitignred (default) `node_modules/` dir shall only emit a warning).

› No; it is not the only source of truth! It must sync properly, just like the claude one does.

› Like calude I'd also like you, codex, to save the sumary after running  `/compact`.

› In scripts/tag_backup.py, after successfully tagging, if interactive or `--remove-old-tags/--remove-tags/--remove-old/--rm-old/--rm-tags/--rm` flag is set to force it, clean up (remove) tags of the parent history, i.e. those commits which are already accessible via the newly created tag. In interactive mode ask (Y/n) for each of those. The `--no-…` variants surpress this behaviour, no tags will be deleted or asked for. Specifying remove and no remove is an error. The result is that --no-rm or non-interactive is not running the extra code, i.e. is as fast as before.

❯ Fix `/home/user/git/luckydonald/xhamsterlocal/ai/output/debug/20260728-203219_245072-save-plan.json` not creating a plan commit (I commited those manually instead.)

❯ Fix the `.confuig` typo - at least here, then commit, then squash.

❯ create a small python script which tags a commit hash as `bak/<commit hash>`, defaulting to the commit at `HEAD`. Into scripts/°base as usual. Also create a intellij run configuration like the existing one. The B emoji is for base, the sparkle for ai, the rest the tool.

› Write unittests for `def is_ai_base_path(path: str) -> bool:`

› Implement the plan.

› also write a few code path examples, which should not match.

› Merge all those `is_ai_base_path` tests of that file into a single test matrix: `dict[str, dict[str, bool]` with `for category, pathes in pathes_matrix: with subTEst(category=category): for path, expected in pathes[category].items(): …`

› how to run that test file for `classify.py`?

› Alright, I want `.ai-ignore` support. This means, like `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` you can paste those globs into text files. A file matched in those is considered AI. Migrate the current globs into that. Note that `!` should be supported as expected.

› This should not be restricted to the repo root, but like the other two systems, it shall work in any folder.
